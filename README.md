# GMX_Advanced_Tools
This repository stores tools to extract customized data from molecular dynamics trajectories enabling parallelization via CUDA and MPI. The tools are developed as the forks to the original GMX HYDORDER tool, the patches enable compilation togather with Gromacs v.2025. Legacy C-style coding of the original tool is preserved for smooth integration.
